terraform questions:


1.when you creating the environment using terraform,what are the components u r been using terraform.
A)vpc subnets ebs volumes internetgateway, s3, alb,nlb, providers
2.how to do changes in already create resources using terraform?
A)Already changes resource one command using terraform import
3)when the terraform run state file created right,what you do that state file, where do you find it ?
A)the terraform state files shows infratcture details in local storing laptop,and storing in s3 bucket are else terraform cloud

4) if you loose terraform tf state file how to retriew it.

5) what are the major features identified in terraform

6) what is the language that used in terraform hcl

7) terraform validate

8) life cycle of terraform: 

9)ansible:

1. ansible vs terraform
2.we have 20 resources public cloud, which just have to destroy
A) terraform destroy -- target resource and id

3)how do you preesure the key the terraform
A) aws cli, store key home, terraform add name to use to work

4) azure storage kept in statefile deleted terraform 

A) all resources are duplicated, and created the resources

5) modules in terraform
A) 1. root module, child moudule, publish module

6)parent module or child module modules called like child module
 root module

8) multiple types provide variable in run time

9) multiple environmrnt in use codes 

10) can you draw backs of terraform
scenero:1- you are managing a complex infrasture with multiple components, and you need to ensure that terraform deploys all resources in the correct order, what steps can you take to accomplish this?
ANS:)Depends upon created resources,
resource "aws_network_interface"

scenero:2)- you need to create multiple instances of the same accomplish this efficiently in terraform?
ANS:-)TERRAFORM ALLOWS TO CREATE LOOPS AND, SAME RESOURCES META ARGUMENT (COUNT), creating resource

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2"{
   count = 3
    Ani = "ami-uut"
    instance_type= :t2.micro"
     tags = {
        name = "example-${count.index}"
}
}

scenero:3:you want create an ec2 instance using terraform and then execute a shell script on the instance after it has been created.how can you achieve this?

ans)remote-exec provisioner using to execute in script

provisiner "remote_exec" {
 inline= []
}

scenero:4) you want to create a terraform module that can be reused across multiple projects but you need to parameterize certain values so that they can be customized for each project.How can you accomplish this in terraform?

ans:) terraform module is set of terraform configurations files in a single directory with one or more.tf files is a module.when you run terraform commands directly from such a directory, it is considered the root module.

module "myec2" {
  source = "./myec2"
  region = "us-east-2"
}


scenero:5) you have a terraform configuration that creates multiple resources in a specific order, but you need to skip a specific resource in the sequence.How can you accomplish this in terraform?
sol: - target 

skip the resouce in order to create a required resources

terraform apply target=aws_network_instanceexanple -target=aws_instance.example

using depends upon option to create required instances.

scenero:6) you want to deploy a terraform configuration that creates an ec2 instance in a specific availability zone, but you arenot sure which availability zone to use how can you dynamicallly select an availability zone at runtime in terraform?

sol:)data resources 

data "aws_availability_zones" "available"{}

resource "random_shuffle" ""azs"{
 input = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
} 

variable "az" {
defaut = "${random_shuffle.azs.result[0]}"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {

}

scenero:7) you have a terraform configuration that provisions on aws ec2 instance security group and keypair, you want to add new ebs volume to the ec2 instance.how would you go about doing this?

sol)resource "aws_ebs_volume" "my_ebs" {
    availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
    size = 20
     tags= {
        Name = "my_web_ebs
}
}

resource " aws_volume_attachment" "ebs_attach" {
  device_name = "/dev/sdf"
  volume_id = "${aws_ebs_volume.my_ebs.id}"
  instance_id = ${aws_instance.myec2.id}"
}


scenero:8) you have an application that requires an aws rds instance and you want to manage its lifecycle using terraform.what steps would you take to achieve this?
sol:)resource "aws_db_instance" "my_rds"{}

scenero:9) you want to deploy a terraform configuration that creates an amazon rds instances in a vpc with a specific subnet group, security group and paramters group?

terraform apply -var "allowed_ip=192.168.0.1/32"

--------------------------------------------------------------
practice:

1. explain core terraform end to end workflow to deploy and delete resources in azure or aws cloud?
a)
